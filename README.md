## About the Video Course
Swift is a powerful programming language that is fun as the syntax is concise yet expressive and feature-rich.
This course helps you take your first steps into programming for Apple devices with Swift. You'll quickly learn Swift and the new features introduced in its latest version. You'll design user interfaces using the UIKit and unleash the power of Storyboards with AutoLayout. You'll use the CoreLocation framework to determine a device's geographic location, altitude, and orientation.
This course lets you explore the most important development tools and techniques used to develop real-world iOS apps while giving you insights into how to improve performance using the latest version of Swift. Finally, you'll learn how to write UI tests for your applications to manage performance and then submit your app to the App Store.
By the end of this course, you will have gotten started as a Swift programmer and will be able to build your own apps.
